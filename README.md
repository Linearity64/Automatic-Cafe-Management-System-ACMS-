# Automatic Cafe Management System (ACMS)

ACMS is an experimental IOT-based system for managing automation in cafe settings. This system features:
- An Arduino based 4WD mobile robot with WiFi connectivity.
- A menu/ordering page for customers
- An admin panel featuring a Dashboard for easy almost real-time monitoring, a Kitchen page for showing orders to the kitchen staff, and a Cashier page for ease of payment.
